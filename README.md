Super Mario (Atari 5200 replica)

Complete recreation of the classic Atari 5200 Super Mario, developed in Unity (C#).
This project was created to study platform mechanics, 2D physics, collisions, and character control, applying good programming practices and modular design.

🔧 Implemented Systems

Player Controller: lateral transfer, jumping, animations, and physics

Coin System: random instantiation and automatic movement

GameManager: score management and game cycle

Teleport Points: system that randomly selects positions for coin respawns

Collisions and Point Detection: integration between Player, Coin, and environment

🧠 Applied Concepts

Using Rigidbody2D and BoxCollider2D

Speed ​​control with linearVelocityX

Coroutines for object respawn times

Direction logic with ternary validation

Clean code and independent scripts for each function
